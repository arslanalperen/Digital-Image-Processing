LAB00 consists of three sections.

In the first section, a function named 'mypgmwrite' is created to write an image in the format [(101,102,103), (104,105,106), (107,108,109)] to a file named 'test.pgm'. It is requested to open the generated PGM file with a HEX editor to verify if it was created correctly.

In the second section, a function named 'mypgmread' is created to read the previously generated file 'test.pgm'. It is requested to obtain the output to ensure that each pixel is read correctly.

In the third and final section, the file named 'lena.pgm' is requested to be read. After successfully reading the file, the values '0' are assigned to rows 30-50, and the modified image is written to a file named 'myLena.pgm'.

The requested tasks are performed step by step in the created file 'LAB00.ipynb'.
